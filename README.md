This project is not done by any means, but I've put a lot of work into it and I'm proud of what's done so far.

The project is structured so that it could be finished as either a web app or a local app - from an MVC viewpoint, the "model" is complete (if not fully tested to be considered correct). I started implementing a web server to serve the model to a web interface, then got lost and decided to learn that part of the project seperately with a simpler game model. That led to the creation of my TicTacToe project hosted as another one of my repositories on GitHub. I'll resume working on this project when I find time.
